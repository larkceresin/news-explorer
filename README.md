# news-explorer

This contains both front and backend for the news-explorer project: made with MERN

## Tech Stack

Frontend: React, Node
Backend: Express, Node, MongoDB

## Running

NPM was used for packages. After locally downloading files run `NPM install` in both front and backend sides

Start backend first, and then front-end
```bash
$ npm run start
```
Backend is set to run at port 3000, if it's changed you'll need to update front-end apis to the specified port it's running at (update at Utils/Auth.js and Components/Saved/SavedNews.js)
